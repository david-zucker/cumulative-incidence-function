Note:

There are two versions here of the code for simulations for a single uniformly distributed covariate:

a. cif-sim-unif-final-14feb22.r
This is the version used for Figure 1 in the paper and Tables S.1-S.4 in the supplementary materials.

b. cif-sim-unif-final-31oct22.r
This is the version used for Figure 3 in the paper and Table S.5 in the supplementary materials.
